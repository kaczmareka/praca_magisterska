              "\"The BBC's director-general has tried to calm tensions among staff over the Israel-Gaza war, telling them to think 'carefully about the language that you use' in the workplace. Tim Davie said employees needed to be 'kind' to each other and 'no one should ever face any fear or prejudice' at their place of work. His email to his workforce comes as one insider at the corporation reported there had been arguments between staff with different views on the Middle-East crisis. There have already been reports of how Jewish staff had been upset at the corporation's refusal to describe Hamas fighters as terrorists. But it has also been claimed that some of its own journalists believe the BBC has been too soft on Israel and was 'dehumanising' Palestinian civilians. Yesterday in an apparent recognition of the tensions among staff, Mr Davie called for calm and respect in the workplace over the issue. Mr Davie has called for calm and respect in the workplace over the issue A mother covers her child's face to protect from the smoke as Palestinians leave from the northern part of the Gaza to flee the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip Admitting it had been a 'incredibly demanding' and 'stressful' time in recent weeks, he wrote: ' Our duty of care to all those impacted is paramount and I would ask everyone to be kind, considerate and supportive of each other. 'It is essential that we act with generosity and humanity, creating an environment where we look after each other in these troubled times, particularly those people most impacted by these awful events.' He added: 'No one should ever face any fear or prejudice in a workplace, and it requires all of us to pull together as one team to live our values. 'This can be harder in these polarised times but we should set the standard as an inclusive, safe environment. I would ask every one of you personally to contribute to this. 'This includes thinking carefully about the language that you use, in person, on email, and also on social media.' Mr Davie went on to provide details for staff who needed support as well as telling them they could use the corporation's whistleblowing services. A BBC source said: 'The BBC isn't some sort of monolithic organisation that doesn't have human beings. One BBC insider admitted they were aware of heated arguments taking place between staff about the war 'There are people working in all sorts of parts of the world and people who like everyone else feels the stresses and strains in relation to covering a complex and difficult conflict.' One BBC insider admitted they were aware of heated arguments taking place between staff about the war. Jewish staff already annoyed about the corporation's refusal to call Hamas fighters terrorists, were further upset when a John Simpson blog about this editorial decision referred to the Nazis. A recent report by The Times said staff who felt the corporation had been too soft on Israel and was 'dehumanising' Palestinian civilians, had been left crying in the toilets, while freelancers had not turned up to work because of it. This comes as the corporation has been fiercely criticised for its coverage during the crisis. Senior figures in the Jewish community in the UK, including the Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis have criticised the decision not to call Hamas terrorists. The president of Israel Isaac Herzog even attacked the BBC over this decision. The BBC also admitted that a controversial TV report about the cause of a Gaza hospital explosion had been flawed. In his staff email, Mr Davie paid tribute to its news teams saying 'those on the ground' had faced 'significant pressures' in doing their work.\\n\""

              "\"A federal agency is seeking to force Starbucks to reopen 23 stores that were allegedly shuttered last year in order to discourage a nationwide union campaign. In a complaint issued on Wednesday by the National Labor Relations Board, it states that Starbucks closed the stores without prior notice to Workers United. Specifically, the agency claims that Starbucks shuttered cafes due to employees engaging in union activities. The agency is now seeking an order that would require Starbucks to immediately reopen the 23 stores and re-hire employees. States affected by the 23 closures include Washington, Colorado, California, Missouri, and Illinois. Starbucks has denied any wrongdoing and said it respects workers' rights to choose whether to unionize. As well as reopening stores and re-hiring employees, the agency is asking the company to negotiate with stores that have unionized and provide compensation to workers who lost pay and benefits. The case will be heard by an administrative judge, whose decision can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and then to a federal appeals court. According to NBC Los Angeles, six cafes in southern California were referenced in the complaint. KUOW also reported that seven of the stores alluded to in the findings were all in Seattle. The Philadelphia Inquirer also highlighted one store in the city that could be reopened. A Starbucks representative told The New York Times: 'Each year, as a standard course of business, we evaluate the store portfolio' and typically open, close or alter stores.' The company told the paper it opened hundreds of new stores last year and closed more than 100, of which about three percent were unionized. The labor board has issued over 100 complaints covering hundreds of accusations of illegal behavior by Starbucks. Judges have ruled against the company over 30 times, but Starbucks has appealed these decisions. The complaint came on the same day that Starbucks released a report on its labor practices prepared by an independent consultant, which had been requested by shareholders. The report found that while there was room for Starbucks to improve its messaging on the union campaign, the company had not adopted 'an anti-union playbook' that involved violating U.S. labor laws. After two years of fighting the unionization of its U.S. stores, Starbucks last week said they were committed to bargaining to reach labor agreements next year. In a letter to Lynne Fox, the president of the Workers United union, Starbucks Chief Partner Officer Sara Kelly said the current bargaining impasse between the two sides 'should not be acceptable to either of us.' Kelly asked to restart bargaining in January, writing: 'We will set as an ambition and hopeful goal the completion of bargaining and the ratification of contracts in 2024.' Workers United said the last bargaining session between the two sides was May 23 of this year. Last Saturday also marked the two-year anniversary of a Starbucks store in Buffalo voting to unionize, becoming the first store to join a union in over three decades. Since then, at least 370 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to unionize, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Currently, there are about 9,600 company-owned Starbucks stores throughout the U.S. Unionizing workers say they're seeking higher pay, more consistent schedules, and more say in issues like store safety and workload during busy times. In October, the company decided to sue Workers United in federal court and demanded they stop using the name Starbucks Workers United after that group posted a pro-Palestinian message on social media. Workers United countersued, saying Starbucks defamed the union by suggesting it supports violence. The change in stance from the company over its dealing with Workers United could be down to business reasons. The company reported record revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in September, and its full-year revenue climbed nearly 12 percent to $35.9 billion. Despite this, Starbucks stock has fallen 10 percent in the last month, after 5,000 workers at more than 200 unionized stores went on strike. Placer.ai, an analytics company, said that after a strong fall, U.S. holiday visits to Starbucks appear to be down from a year ago.\""

The factory’s other 1,074 robots were made in Shanghai. Volkswagen used to import shock absorbers from Central Europe for cars it makes at Chinese factories. Now it buys them from a company in China for 40 percent less. After relying for decades on engineers in Germany to design cars for the Chinese market, Volkswagen has begun hiring for a team of nearly 3,000 Chinese engineers, which will include hundreds transferred from Volkswagen operations elsewhere in China. They will design electric cars at VW’s industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China. The new strategy, which Volkswagen calls “In China, for China,” is another sign of how China’s commanding lead in electric vehicles has upended global auto making. Chinese car brands are appearing more in Germany and throughout Europe, causing politicians to worry about job losses.\n",

All electric: Toyota plan a production version of two concept cars - a compact urban SUV next year and a sport crossover in 2025 I am honoured to have been named AA Campaigner For Motoring at the prestigious Guild of Motoring Writers' annual awards dinner held at the RAC Club in London's Pall Mall on Thursday night. Judges praised a series of Daily Mail articles including 'the story of a woman being chased by debt collectors acting for TfL over an alleged traffic infringement', and reports on controversial 20mph zones and potholed roads.\\n\",\n          \"Amazon was quieter about its A.I. plans until more recently. In September, it announced that it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up that competes with OpenAI, and develop advanced computing chips together. Amazon also introduced a platform this year that allows customers to have access to different A.I. systems. As the leading provider of cloud computing, Amazon already has business customers storing vast amounts of information on its cloud servers. Companies were interested in using chatbots in their workplaces, Mr. Selipsky said, but they wanted to make sure the assistants would safeguard those hoards of corporate data and keep their information private. Many companies \\u201ctold me that they had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns,\\u201d he said. In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot, Mr. Selipsky said. Amazon Q, for example, can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users. At a company where an employee in marketing may not have access to sensitive financial forecasts, Q can emulate that by not providing that employee with such financial data when asked.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Incident\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Coastal erosion\",\n          \"Electric vehicle announcement\",\n          \"A.I. security concerns\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Confidence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 20.785984983088284,\n        \"min\": 26.0,\n        \"max\": 100.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 79,\n        \"samples\": [\n          82.0,\n          90.4,\n          88.8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.5641489028930664,\n        \"max\": 0.5641489028930664,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5641489028930664\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Incident_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Coastal erosion\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Confidence_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 20.895892399989027,\n        \"min\": 26.0,\n        \"max\": 100.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 79,\n        \"samples\": [\n          79.8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Time_2\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.5391755104064941,\n        \"max\": 0.5391755104064941,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.5391755104064941\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Incident_3\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Coastal erosion\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Confidence_3\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 20.273330343885863,\n        \"min\": 26.0,\n        \"max\": 100.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 80,\n        \"samples\": [\n          82.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Time_3\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.4676516056060791,\n        \"max\": 0.4676516056060791,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4676516056060791\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
